# Optimal-Seeding-for-FIFA-World-Cup-2026
The FIFA World Cup 2026 will feature 48 teams split into 12 groups of 4. The goal of this project is to design an optimal seeding strategy that maximizes fairness and competitiveness by ensuring balanced group compositions. The project focuses on:

- **Fair Matchups**: Reducing the likelihood of top teams facing each other early in the tournament.
- **Economic Benefits**: A well-structured tournament increases viewer engagement and revenue for FIFA.
- **Increased Excitement**: Balanced group stages create more exciting matches, enhancing the overall entertainment value of the tournament.

## Data Collection

We used two primary datasets:
1. **FIFA World Cup 1930-2022 All Match Dataset**: Contains data on 964 FIFA matches from 1930 to 2022, including match results, teams, and scores.
2. **Confederation Dataset**: Maps countries to their respective football confederations (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, UEFA).

### Key Features in the Dataset:
- Match results (Home/Away teams, scores)
- Team rankings and points
- Confederation information (essential for maintaining confederation diversity in groups)

## Optimization Model

We developed an optimization model to assign the 48 qualifying teams into 12 groups, each containing 4 teams, while adhering to the following constraints:
- Each group must have exactly 4 teams.
- At least 3 different confederations must be represented in each group.
- The sum of team points in each group must be within a specified range around the average group points.

### Objective Function
The objective is to **minimize the maximum deviation** between group points and ensure balanced group stages with competitive matches.

## Results

After running the optimization, we achieved 12 groups with a fair distribution of team strength and confederation representation. Here are some key group assignments:
- **Group A**: China, Uruguay, Sweden, Republic of Ireland
- **Group F**: Iraq, Algeria, Argentina, Switzerland
- **Group G**: Japan, Senegal, Paraguay, Belgium

These groupings balance both geographic diversity and team strength, ensuring an exciting tournament.

## Limitations
- The optimization uses FIFA rankings based solely on World Cup matches. This does not account for other international matches, which are factored into FIFAâ€™s real-life rankings.
- Publicly available data does not include the latest team performances outside the World Cup, which could affect ranking accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scipy` for optimization.

## Key Concepts:
Seeding
Ranking Algorithm (SUM)
Optimization
Objective Function
Constraints
Historical Match Weighting
Multicollinearity
Prescriptive Analytics
Balanced Grouping

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data and optimization techniques can be applied to a real-world sports scenario to enhance the fairness and excitement of a global tournament. By balancing team strengths and ensuring diversity in group compositions, we provide an optimal seeding strategy for the FIFA World Cup 2026.
